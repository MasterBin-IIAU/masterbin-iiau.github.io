We present SPLT, a robust and real-time long-term tracking framework based on the skimming and perusal modules. The perusal module consists of an effective bounding box regressor and a robust target verifier. Besides, a novel skimming module is designed to speed up the image-wide global search. The proposed method runs in real-time and achieves the best performance on the VOT-2018 long-term and OxUvA long-term benchmarks.
