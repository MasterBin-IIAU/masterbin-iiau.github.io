We present a unified method, termed Unicorn, that can simultaneously solve four tracking problems (SOT, MOT, VOS, MOTS) with a single network using the same model parameters. 
Unicorn provides a unified solution, adopting the same input, backbone, embedding,
and head across all tracking tasks. For the first time, we accomplish the great unification of the tracking network architecture and learning
paradigm. Unicorn performs on-par or better than its task-specific counterparts in 8 tracking datasets.
