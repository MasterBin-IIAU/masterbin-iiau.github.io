We address the challenge of performing open-vocabulary video instance segmentation (OV-VIS) in real-time. We propose TROY-VIS, which significantly improves processing speed while maintaining high accuracy. We introduce three key techniques: (1) Decoupled Attention Feature Enhancer (2) Flash Embedding Memory (3) Kernel Interpolation.
