We introduce an end-to-end trainable video object segmentation architecture that integrates a differentiable few-shot learning module to segment the taget object. We further go beyond standard few-shot learning techniques by learning what the few-shot learner should learn, in order to maximize segmentation accuracy. Our approach sets a new state-ofthe-art on the large-scale YouTube-VOS 2018 dataset.
